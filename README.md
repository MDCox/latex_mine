LaTeX Mine
===========

Query in the LaTeX Mine and dig out some Ruby!    

###What is it?
--------------    

Input a LaTeX equation, and Ruby Mine will convert it to executable Ruby code that will run and output the answer.  Think of it as an advanced calculator.    

The main reason I'm working on this is to learn common math symbols and their meaning.  As a programmer, I find it easier to think of things in terms of code. When it comes to math, I feel like I'll grok it better if I can equate a specific mathematical operator with a particular block of code.    

###So why Ruby?
-------------    

1) I really like Ruby.  It's fun to read and write, and when a program is for my own personal enrichment, though I hope it helps others, that's really all that matters.    

2) I don't know any large Math libraries for Ruby off the top of my head.  I'm sure they exist, but whenever I have to do mathy things I head to Python.  Using Ruby means that unless I go out of my way to look up a gem to cheat with, I'll have to implement each mathematical function myself.  When it comes to learning, the hard way is often the best way.
